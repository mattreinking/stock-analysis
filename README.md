# Stock Analysis

## Overview of Project
Analyze a dataset of the stock market to calculate the overall yearly return of each stock.

### Purpose
This project is meant to work through a small dataset of the stock market calculating each stock's yearly return. In doing this task, we will be refactoring a VBA script to make the code run more efficient and improve the speed of execution.


## Results
The process of refactoring was done by downloading the script with the structured list of objectives to enhance the script's quality. Here is a sample of the script with the required objectives completed. The code is organized with minimal logic to use less memory as well as provide clean code. Spacing and grouping also taken into account for future users/viewers to promote reading effciency.

Here is the run time of the code averaging less than a tenth of a second when executed

### Analysis
An analysis of the yearly stock performances show 2017 was much more successful in generating positive returns. Only one stock in the 2017 dataset had a negative annual return. DQ generated a return as high 200% quadrupling their value

2018 proved to be an adverse year with only two stocks having a net positive return. A year prior DQ was shown to have the highest growth only to have the worst return this year losing as much as 63% in returns. Based on the volatility of DQ, it may be better advised to avoid investing until there is a much more consistent dataset.

## Summary

### Advantages vs Disadvantages of Refactoring Code
Refactoring is a key part in coding and should always be good practice and discipline in improving design and functionality. There are advantages and disadvantages to refactoring code. The most important advantages to refactoring code are building to enhance simplicity and improving quality. Mastering refactoring code will immensely improve one's ability to decipher logic with an efficient method. However, some disadvantages of refactoring code can be lacking sufficient datasets the code will be tailored for. Inversely, refactored code can efficient for a smaller dataset but it will not translate well to much larger dataset. Sometimes, the pressure of a project deadline can be a disadvantage; there simply will not be enough time to go through a refactoring process before release into production.

### Refactoring the VBA Script
Refactoring the VBA script showed a huge benefit in decreasing the execution time by as much as three tenths of a second. This proves refactoring code is an excellent practice in simplifying logic and accomplishing a task while using less memory power.
